# Functional Prints
This repository contains `.stl` files of some functional models.
## Kitchen Handle
### v1.0
The current version didn't actually end up working, it was way too large for some reason ðŸ˜ž. I have to see if and where measurements/dimensions have gone wrong.
## Pixel 5 Case
### v1.0
This version fit just fine but it was not structurally sound since not being able to bend it meant that the outer "peninsular" ring ended up breaking. To fix this, I am essentially mirroring the button gap on the right so that it is easier to bend the case without breaking it.
### v1.1
